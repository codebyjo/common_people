	<section><h2><span class="left_text">She came from Greece</span>><span class="right_text">she had a thirst for knowledge</span></h2>
	</section>
	<section><h2>She studied sculpture at Saint Martin's College, that's where I caught her eye.</h2>
	</section>
	<section><h2>She told me that her Dad was loaded</h2>
	</section>
	<section><h2>I said in that case I'll have a rum and coke-cola.</h2>
	</section>
	<section><h2>She said fine and in thirty seconds time she said:</h2>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>I want to live like common people</h3>
		<h3>I want to do whatever common people do</h3>
		<h3>I want to sleep with common people</h3>
	</section>
	<section>I want to sleep with common people like you. 
	</section>
	<section>Well what else could I do - I said I'll see what I can do. 
	</section>
	<section>I took her to a supermarket
	</section>
	<section>I don't know why but I had to start it somewhere, so it started there. 
	</section>
	<section>I said pretend you've got no money, she just laughed and said oh you're so funny. 
	</section>
	<section>I said yeah? Well I can't see anyone else smiling in here. 
	</section>
	<section>Are you sure you want to live like common people
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>You want to see whatever common people see</p>
		<p>You want to sleep with common people</p>
		<p>you want to sleep with common people like me</p>
	</section>
	<section>But she didn't understand, she just smiled and held my hand. 
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>Rent a flat above a shop, cut your hair and get a job. </p>
		<p>Smoke some fags and play some pool, pretend you never went to school. </p>
	</section>
	<section>But still you'll never get it right
	</section>
	<section>'cos when you're laid in bed at night watching roaches climb the wall 
	</section>
	<section>If you call your Dad he could stop it all. 
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>You'll never live like common people</p>
		<p>You'll never do what common people do</p>
		<p>You'll never fail like common people</p>
	</section>
	<section>You'll never watch your life slide out of view, and dance and drink and screw 
	</section>
	<section>Because there's nothing else to do. 
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>Sing along with the common people</p>
		<p>sing along and it might just get you thru'</p>
		<p>Laugh along with the common people</p>
	</section>
	<section>Laugh along even though they're laughing at you and the stupid things that you do. 
	</section>
	<section>Because you think that poor is cool. 
	</section>
	<section>I want to live with common people, I want to live with common people [etc..]
